# SBVI assignment objectives:
1) Development of an algorithm for traffic sign detection
2) Development of an algorithm to identify the class of the traffic sign represented in a single-sign image. (different data set)
3) Development of an algorithm that, given a single-sign image of a specific class traffic sign, recognizes the traffic sign shown in the image
